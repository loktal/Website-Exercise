# Website-Exercise


So this is an introduction to html and css.
i've practiced this by doing a small website.

if you want to run it:
1. Go to the folder with the repository with your terminal
2. run a simple python http server with the command: python3 -m http.server 
(if you have issue doing this go to this website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server
3. then go to http://localhost:8000
